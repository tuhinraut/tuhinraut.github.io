theoretical molecular simulation, ML heavy, Molecular evolution there. approches are mostly generative models and the theory of spinglases

Ion channel protein design, using AI, more in general label nerves

Biophysics of ion channels and membranes, mostly MD simulations and theory.

Small Molecule design, and drug binding etc.

In the beginning projects in several areas

1. Molecular Biology and Phylogenetics

2. Spin Glasses and Complexity

LAMMPS for more of the fundamental models created by the lab.

Statistical Mechanics and Statistical Thermodynamics
