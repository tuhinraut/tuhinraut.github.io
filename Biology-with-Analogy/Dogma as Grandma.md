# Dogma as Grandma

*In this blog, we will draw analogies between our grandma's secret recipes and the process of protein synthesis and cell's functioning through the central dogma of molecular biology, i.e. DNA --> RNA --> Protein. We will also explore topics far beyond just the simple central dogma and explore analogies between the genome, plasmids, protein folding machineries and many other concepts. But had to keep the title "Dogma as Grandma" because how could I not.... .* 

*Note:- Anywhere in the story, you feel like asking the question "How did the cell think of this?" or "is the cell a sentient being by itself?", the answer to them all is EVOLUTION!!!*

## Grandma's Cookbook (DNA)

Let's say you have a super grandma (which you do, ik) and she makes the world's best food. Like everything she makes is just the best. When once you pleaded with her to reveal her secrets, she pulls out her years old cookbook that had been passed down to her from her grandmother. The recipes have the instructions regarding what all ingredients are required, how to mix those and prepare the dish. Your eyes light up on seeing the holy grail and you reach out to grab the book and go to town with it, but as it is the only copy of the recipes she has, she slaps your hand lightly and says you can't have it, yet. She knows you too well and how careless you can be :'(. 

::: analogy
The cookbook represents the genome, which contains all the instructions needed to build and maintain the organism. Just like the cookbook, the DNA is carefully protected and cannot be directly used to make proteins. DNA has fundamental units which are responsible for encoding all of the information and they are Adenine, Thymine, Guanine and Cytosine (ATGC). These are the ABCs of DNA.

In the genome, individual genes can be looked as recipes in the cookbook. they are responsible for making one complete protein, or sometimes multiple proteins as well, which usually serve a particular function.

## Her Conditions and Your Masterplan (mRNA)

But being the kind soul she is, she can't see you be sad. So, she allows you to jot it down on another piece of paper. But before you run off to the kitchen to make <insert: your favourite dish> (Mine is Biryani btw :), she stops you. As it's a secret family recipe, she says you have to shred the paper within 3 hours (please let me take some artistic liberties, otherwise this won't work `(・_・;)`). Being the good grand-son/grand-daughter you are, you oblige. So, you use your big beautiful brain and come up with an idea. After inquiring if she would allow you to copy the recipe as many times as you want (to which she smilingly says, yes!), you just write parts of the recipe at a time, such that it just covers the top section of the page and would shred the latest even if you are not done making the recipe to completion yet. And being the GenZ kid, you use acronyms instead of full words, which can't be understood by anyone else except the GenZs.  You give yourself a pat on the back and get to work writing down the first part of making the biryani, "Marinating the Meat".

::: analogy
The cells makes a copy of RNA, mRNA (messenger RNA) to be specific, from the DNA master-copy. But these mRNA copies aren't permanent, they get degraded over time (like within 2-10 minutes), because of the presence of an additional hydroxyl group which makes it more liable to oxidising agents as a method of gene expression regulation. So, to protect the main information from getting degraded, before its conversion into protein, usually there is a filler poly-A tail added to the end of mRNA. Similar to your encryption using slangs and shorthand, there is a change made to the RNA molecule as compared to the DNA, the T from ATGC in DNA is changed to U (Uracil). This is more down to making the RNA more unstable. Unstability is directly proportional to better control over gene regulation.

## Let Him COOK! (Protein synthesis)

Now you run off to your local shop and hand the shopkeeper over the list of ingredients (Thankfully he understood your slangs). Going down the list, he gives you all of the ingredients. You pay him and dash back home to marinate the chicken you just bought (you are under a time limit, remember!). You follow the recipe to a T, and add all the ingredients one after another according to script. Then you cover it with a loin cloth and stow it away for later use. But you realise one thing, that 3 hours is long enough to not rush it for most of the recipes.

So, you tap into your inner Viru Sahastrabudhhe, [a.k.a. Virus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UptwZdRtrkI), and next time make the copy of 2 parts at a time and decide to multitask to save time. But not all parts are as easy as marinating the chicken though. Some require specific instruments and conditions to work. You can't cook Biryani in the oven ([Seems we humans are great at defying odds](https://foodiesterminal.com/2018/06/how-to-make-chicken-dum-biriyani-in-oven/), but anyways my point stands). It requires you to use a sealed pot on a stove-top.

You toil through all of the steps and by night, you have prepared your "Ultra Pro Max Chicken Biryani" to completion and the family celebrates the coming of the new MasterChef in the house!!! While, grandma sitting in the corner raises a glass to you.

## Oopsies! (Errors)

Now that you are a "decorated chef", you decide to take up a more complex task- Making ice-cream. For this you decided to do it properly though. Being flush with cash (I hope you are), you go out and buy a freaking "Ice-Cream Maker". But being lost in salivary imaginations, you forget to add sugar to the recipe copy and eventually you miss adding it in while making the ice-cream as well. When you sit back and turn on your favourite show to watch ([DankPods](https://www.youtube.com/@DankPods) all the way!!), you are disgusted by the bitterness of the "Coffee Ice-Cream" that you have made and your day is ruined.

But it is not always you that is at fault. After being bittered by the ice-cream, you are now careful while noting down the recipes. But on your birthday, when you were making the "Grandma's Special Chocolate Cake", the shopkeeper gave you baking powder instead of baking soda. You being the naive MasterChef, thought that both of them must be the same and added it anyways. Disaster strikes! The cake has turned bitter and flat and no amount of chocolate in the icing can save it. (Can you guess, what tasting food I like the least?). You cry and have to buy a cake from the bakery nearby to save the party :'(

## Entering MasterChef (Plasmids and Horizontal Gene Transfer)

After the passing of your grandma, it was you with whom she entrusted her cookbook with and you promise yourself to continue the legacy. Now that you have established yourself as a great cook, your family secretly fills your application to enter MasterChef. Under pressure of proving that you are not just some amateur "home cook", but a "Masterchef", you go in search of exploring other cuisines because in a contest you can't just be making one cuisine recipes. You have to be fluent in cuisines from around the world. So, you befriend Giovanni, from another cullinarily rich country, Italy. He also had a similar origin story as you. He has also inherited a cookbook from his Nonna, and would love to share parts of it with you. 

So, you hatch out a plan to have him scan the copy of the book and send it over to you and also send some over to him of your grandma's secret recipe. So, now you have a copy of some of the recipes of Giovanni's Nonna's original cookbook (Yipee!!). But still, you weren't able to win the whole thing, but, hey, its the effort that counts, remember that.

## A Thieve arrives (Reverse Transcriptase)



## You become a Gastronomist (Genetic Engineering)

The effort and research you put in to preparing for the contest didn't go in vain though. You have now accumulated a vast amount of knowledge tinkering with the recipe, tweaking the ingredients and trying to improve the flavour of the food. This has helped you make the receipes passed down from your grandma even better. You found new combos which were just Mmm-hmm, mmm-hmm ([Lobster Brain Butter, sounds horrifying, surprisingly not so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQGyweHbusU)). But in the process of making stuff better, you did encounter various combos that DID NOT go so well together (Chocolate glaze and salmon do not go well together (╯°□°）╯).
