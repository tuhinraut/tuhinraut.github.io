*In this blog, we will draw analogies between our grandma's secret recipes and the process of protein synthesis and cell's functioning through the central dogma of molecular biology, i.e. DNA --> RNA --> Protein. We will also explore topics far beyond just the simple central dogma and explore analogies between the genome, plasmids, protein folding machineries and many other concepts. But had to keep the title "Dogma as Grandma" because how can I not.... .* 

*Note:- Anywhere in the story, you feel like asking the question "How did the cell think of this?", the answer to them all is EVOLUTION!!!*

## Grandma's Cookbook

Let's say you have a super grandma (which you do, ik) and she makes the world's best food. Like everything she makes is just the best. When once you ask her to reveal her secrets, she pulls out her years old cookbook that had been passed down to her from her grandmother. This book has the recipes to all of the standard dishes. The recipes have the instructions regarding what all ingredients are required, how to mix those and prepare the dish. Your eyes light upon seeing the holy grail and you reach out to grab the book and go to town with it, but as it is the only copy of the recipes she has, she slaps your hand lightly and says you can't have it. She knows you too well and how careless you can be :'(. 


## Her Conditions and Your Masterplan

But being the kind soul she is, she can't see you be sad. So, she allows you to jot it down on another piece of paper. But before you run off to the shop to make your favourite dish <insert: your favourite dish> (Mine is Biryani btw :), she stops you. As it a secret family recipe, she says you have to burn the paper down after 3 hours from the bottom right corner (please let me take some artistic liberties, otherwise this won't work). Being the good grand-son/grand-daughter you are, you oblige. So, you use your big beautiful brain and come up with an idea. After inquiring if she would allow you to copy the recipe as many times as you want (to which she smilingly says, yes!), you just write parts of the recipe at a time, such that it just covers the top-left section of the page and would burn the latest even if you are not done making the recipe to completion yet. And being the GenZ kid, you use acronyms instead of full words, which can't be understood by anyone else except the GenZs.  You give yourself a pat on the back and get to work writing down the first part of making the biryani, "Marinating the Meat".

## Let Him COOK!

Now you run off to your local shop and hand the shopkeeper over the list of ingredients (Thankfully he understood your slangs). Going down the list, he gives you all of the ingredients. You pay him and dash back home to marinate the chicken you just bought (you are under a time limit, remember!). You follow the recipe to a T, and add all the ingredients one after another according to script. Then you cover it with a loin cloth and stow it away for later use. But you realise one thing, that 3 hours is long enough to not rush it for most of the recipes.

So, you tap into your inner Viru Sahastrabudhhe, a.k.a. Virus, and next time make the copy of 2 parts at a time and decide to multitask to save time. But not all parts are as easy as marinating the chicken. Some require specific instruments and conditions to work. You can't cook Biryani in the oven ([Seems we humans are great at defying odds](https://foodiesterminal.com/2018/06/how-to-make-chicken-dum-biriyani-in-oven/), but anyways). It requires you to use a sealed pot on a stove-top.

You toil through all of the steps and by night, you have prepared your "Ultra Pro Max Chicken Biryani" to completion and the family celebrates the coming of the new MasterChef in the house!!! While, grandma sitting in the corner raises a glass to you (DiCaprio style).

## Oopsies!

Now that you are a decorated chef, you decide to take up a more complex task- Making ice-cream. For this you decided to do it properly though. Being flush with cash (I hope you are), you go out and buy a freaking "Ice-Cream Maker". But being lost in salivary imaginations, you forget to add sugar to the recipe copy and eventually you miss adding it in while making the ice-cream as well. When you sit back and turn on your favourite show to watch ([DankPods](https://www.youtube.com/@DankPods) all the way!!), you are disgusted by the bitterness of the "Coffee Ice-Cream" that you have made and your day is ruined (Ahh, my PKCELL !!!).

But it is not always you that is at fault. After being bittered by the ice-cream, you are now careful while noting down the recipes. But on your birthday, when you were making the "Grandma's Special Chocolate Cake", the shopkeeper gave you baking powder instead of baking soda. You being the naive MasterChef, thought that both of them must be the same and added it anyways. Disaster strikes! The cake has turned bitter and no amount of chocolate in the icing can save it. (Can you guess, what tasting food I like the least?). You cry and have to buy a cake from the bakery nearby to save the party :'(
