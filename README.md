# My Personal Website

Welcome to my digital space! I'm Tuhin Kumar Raut, a Biochemical Engineering and Biotechnology student at IIT Delhi.

## About This Site

This website serves as my personal portfolio where I share my journey in computational biology and biotechnology research. Here, you'll find:

- **My Research Projects**: I work on molecular dynamics simulations, nanopore sequencing, and AI-driven protein design
- **Science Communication**: I believe complex biological concepts should be accessible to everyone, so I write about cutting-edge research and explain it through relatable analogies
- **Failed Ideas & Lessons**: Science isn't just about successes - I also share research ideas that didn't work out and what I learned from them
- **Academic Journey**: My ongoing projects, collaborations, and the grants that have supported my work

## What I'm Passionate About

I'm fascinated by the intersection of biology and technology. My research focuses on understanding life at the molecular level and using computational tools to solve biological problems. I'm particularly interested in:

- Making biotechnology more accessible and understandable
- Exploring how close we are to achieving sci-fi-like biological innovations
- Using analogies to bridge the gap between complex science and everyday understanding
